# Chatbot for Automated Support / Customer Service 
This project implements a chatbot for automating support and customer service interactions using AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) techniques. The chatbot is designed to handle user queries, provide relevant responses, and exhibit various behaviors to enhance the conversational experience regarding the scheduling appointment to a specific doctor.

# Overview
The primary objective of this project is to automate support interactions using a chatbot, thereby saving costs and improving efficiency. The chatbot interacts with users, understands their queries, and responds appropriately based on predefined rules and patterns.

# Support / Customer Service Flowchart
The support/customer service flowchart demonstrates the key use case of automating support interactions using a chatbot. Users can input questions or select topics, and the chatbot guides them through the process. Users have the option to indicate whether the response meets their needs or not, and the chatbot adjusts its responses accordingly.

# AIML Code

In the AIML code we use the following tags to demonstrate the productive way for the chatbot:
  - that
  - topic
  - Variable: set
  - Variable: get
  - sets
  - map
  - properties
  - substitutions
  - button
  - link
  - reply

# Chatbot Behavior
The chatbot demonstrates the following behaviors:

<b>1. Be Proactive</b> 
The chatbot initiates interactions with users, offers assistance, and guides them through the support process without waiting for explicit user input.

<b>2. Exhibit Conscientiousness</b>
The chatbot shows care and attentiveness towards users' needs, ensuring that their queries are addressed effectively and efficiently.

<b>3. Exhibit Communicability</b>
The chatbot communicates clearly and effectively with users, using understandable language and providing helpful responses.

<b>4. Apply Damage Control</b>
The chatbot gracefully handles situations where users indicate dissatisfaction or encounter errors, providing alternative options or escalating to human support agents when necessary.

# Conclusion
This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a chatbot for automating support and customer service interactions. By implementing various behaviors and following the support/customer service flowchart, the chatbot provides a seamless and efficient support experience for users.
